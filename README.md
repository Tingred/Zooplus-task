Using NBP API (see hints) create service (using SpringBoot, Java/Kotlin, use additional tool or framework that you need), that will expose following endpoints:
GET /api/exchange-rates/{currencyCode} - returns currency exchange rate PLN to {currencyCode} for the last 5 business days.
GET /api/gold-price/average - returns average gold price for the last 14 business days
Please upload your project to GitHub repository and share link with us. We're waiting for your response 2 weeks.
